## Assessing Transit Suitability

This repository contains code and HTML maps for several transit suitability analyses.

`SaltLakeCounty-CMP6455.R` is the original code, which was written for a project in a spatial data analytics course at the University of Utah (see [*Assessing transit suitability in Salt Lake County*](https://dritter4.github.io/transit-suitability-slco-background/)).

`SLCo-GrowthProjections.R` incorporates population and job forecasts into the original analysis (see [*Incorporating growth projections into a transit suitability analysis*](https://dritter4.github.io/incorporating-growth-projections-slco/)).
